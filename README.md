# SVG generator

## Description    
   This project uses Javascript classes and constructors to generate 3 SVG shapes. 

   The code uses npm Inquirer and npm File System to obtain the user input and generate the logo.svg file.

   The code also uses a JS If statement to confirm the letter count is between 1 and 3. Then a Switch is used to determine the shape selected. 
 

## Usage

    With a terminal open use the command "node index.js" to start the inquirer/program.
